This project is my introduction to Flask.  I'm going to build a basic app based on scripter and then get it to work on Heroku.

It'll go in stages, with a single repo and we'll keep track of the commits at each step.  The SHA-256 digest of the corresponding commit is shown for each step.

- Step 1:  [README.md](README1.md)
