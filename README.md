This project is my introduction to [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org).  I'm going to build a basic app based on scripter and then get it to work in the cloud on Heroku.

We go in stages, with a single repo and keeping track of the commits at each step.  The SHA-256 digest of the commit is shown for each step.

- 1  [README.md](md/README1.md) ``c817``
Python 2.7

- 2 [README.md](md/README2.md) ``233d`` 
Heroku, pipenv

- 3 [README.md](md/README3.md) ``xxxx`` Python 3, gunicorn
